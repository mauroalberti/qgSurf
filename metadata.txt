name=qgSurf
description=Processing of geological planes and surfaces
about=qgSurf is a field-mapping/structural-geology plugin for: a) estimating the attitude of sub-planar geological surfaces given three or more points on a topographic surface; b) determining the intersection between a geological plane and a topographic surface; c) calculating the distance between points and a geological plane; d) plotting geological data in a stereonet.

changelog=
  2.0.0: added stereonet tool from geocouche; added module for calculation of distance between points and a geological plane; improved best-fit plane module;code refactoring; removed old modules dependences
  1.0.0: added pygsf; minor modifications to GUI and help for best-fit-plane calculations
  0.5.0: porting to QGIS 3
  0.4.1: fixed bug related to deformation orientation; (re)added warning on geographic DEMs, still not correctly supported
  0.4.0: added support for geographic DEMs; fixed conceptual bug related to the use of the project CRS
  0.3.5: fixed bug related to the use of polar CRS (i.e., lat-lon)
  0.3.4: removed (for QGis compatibility issues) both "geosurface_simulation" and "geosurface_deformation" modules: they are now an independent, stand-alone Python project (simSurf, available in GitHub)
  0.3.3: best-fit-plane: added point input from loaded point/line layer
  0.3.2: best-fit-plane: added saving of one or more point set solutions as shapefiles
  0.3.1: support for on-the-fly-projection for Best-Fit-Plane interpolation and DEM-plane intersection; minor bugs fixing
  0.3.0: added modules for the processing of geological surfaces (non-planar)
  0.2.3: fix graphic bug (dem intersection symbol not deleted on plugin close)
  0.2.2: version compatible with QGis 2.0
  0.2.1: calculate best-fit plane orientation given points drawn in the QGis map window
  0.2.0: map display/interaction is now through the QGis map window
