changelog=
  0.2.0: map display/interaction is now through the QGis map window
  0.2.1: calculate best-fit plane orientation given points drawn in the QGis map window
  0.2.2: version compatible with QGis 2.0
  0.2.3: fix graphic bug (dem intersection symbol not deleted on plugin close)
  0.3.0: added modules for the processing of geological surfaces (non-planar)
  0.3.1: support for on-the-fly-projection for Best-Fit-Plane interpolation and DEM-plane intersection; minor bugs fixing 
  0.3.2: best-fit-plane: added saving of one or more point set solutions as shapefiles
  0.3.3: best-fit-plane: added point input from loaded point/line layer
  0.3.4: removed (for QGis compatibility issues) both "geosurface_simulation" and "geosurface_deformation" modules: they are now an independent, stand-alone Python project (simSurf, available in GitHub)
  0.3.5: fixed bug related to the use of polar CRS (i.e., lat-lon)
  0.4.0: added support for geographic DEMs; fixed conceptual bug related to the use of the project CRS
