# qgSurf

qgSurf is a QGIS plugin for the processing of geological planes and surfaces.


It allows to examine the relationships between geological attitudes and topography by:

- deriving the geological attitude of a plane given three or more points;

- computing the topographic trace of a geological planar surface given its attitude and an origin point;

- calculating the distance between points and a geological plane;

- plotting geological data in stereonet (tool imported from geocouche of the same author).
