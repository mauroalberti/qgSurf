# qgSurf

qgSurf is a QGIS plugin for the processing of geological planes and surfaces.


It allows to examine the relationships between geological attitudes and topography in two ways:

- to derive the geological attitude of a plane given three or more points

- to compute the topographic trace of a geological planar surface given its attitude and an origin point.
